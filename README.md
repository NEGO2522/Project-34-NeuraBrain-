# NeuraBrain  
### AI-Powered Cognitive Learning Intelligence System  

---

## Overview

NeuraBrain is a cognitive intelligence platform designed to improve how students retain knowledge. Instead of tracking only content completion, the system models learning behavior and predicts memory decay to help students revise at the right time.

It focuses on retention, not just effort.

## Problem

Students struggle with retention, not effort.

They frequently switch between topics, study inconsistently, forget core fundamentals over time, and prepare randomly before exams. There is no scientific way for them to measure what they truly remember.

Existing learning platforms track what has been completed but do not analyze how much has been retained.

There is currently no intelligent system that:

- Tracks memory decay  
- Detects conceptual weakness early  
- Predicts what a student is likely to forget  
- Adapts revision timing automatically  

As a result, students revise reactively instead of proactively.

## Solution

NeuraBrain introduces an AI-driven learning pattern engine that predicts knowledge decay before performance drops.

The system:

- Tracks time spent per topic  
- Monitors study consistency and switching behavior  
- Calculates a dynamic retention score  
- Models memory decay over time  
- Identifies high-risk topics before exams  
- Automatically schedules personalized revision  
- Generates adaptive quizzes to reinforce weak concepts  

Instead of tracking what was completed, NeuraBrain predicts what will be forgotten.

It transforms learning from passive studying into data-driven cognitive optimization.
